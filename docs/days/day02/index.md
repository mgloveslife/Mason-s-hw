Before we get into programming it is important to be able to navigate different systems using a command line interface.  On most systems this will a bash type shell running on linux/unix/macOS.  There are a few different command line interfaces on Windows, but bash using [WSL2/Ubuntu](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) is the recommended configuration. Mastery of bash programming is not required to complete this course but simple navigational skills are recommended.  [linuxjourney.com](https://linuxjourney.com) provides an interactive tutorial on using Linux and the command line.
