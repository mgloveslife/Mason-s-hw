Day 5 consists of hours 6 and 7 in the _C++ in 24 Hours_ book and focuses on loops and arrays/strings.  
Even if these concepts seems like a review if you are familiar with them, it is recommended to read and complete each section to strengthen c/c++ skills.  The end of section activities should be completed in CLion and pushed to your private CodingAblate Repo.  This is done by creating a new day5 folder and updating the CMakeLists.txt file with any new files created in that folder.

**Goals**
1. Complete activities for Hours 6 and 7.
2. Commit these activities and push to your private CodingAblate Repo.
