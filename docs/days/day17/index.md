[PETSc Tutorials](https://petsc.org/release/tutorials/) provides many tutorial examples organized by physics and problem time.  Today's work includes exploring these tutorials and selecting a few tutorials to understand and reproduce based upon your experience or area of interest. 

**Goals**
1. Select a few tutorials to understand and reproduce in your code.
2. Commit these activities and push to your private CodingAblate Repo.
