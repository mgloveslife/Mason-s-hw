This guide will provide a step-by-step guide to downloading, building, and running ABLATE.  This guide assumes that you are building and running ABLATE on your local machine. Additional directions are available for specific computing environments.

1. **Installing Dependencies** Regardless of how you run ABLATE the first step is installing [ABLATE dependencies](https://ablate.dev/content/development/InstallingDependencies.html).
1. **Forking ABLATE** If you plan on making any contributions to ABLATE you must first [Fork ABLATE](https://ablate.dev/content/development/UsingGitWithABLATE.html#forking-ablate).  This creates a version of ABLATE that you can modify, commit, and test.  When complete, you can create a Pull Request to bring your changes back to the main branch.
1. **Building ABLATE** Inorder to run ABLATE using a text input file or make contributions you will need to [download and build ablate](https://ablate.dev/content/development/BuildingAblateLocally.html).
1. **Running ABLATE with an Input File** ABLATE includes a yaml parser for setting up and configuring simulations.  [Step-by-Step instructions](https://ablate.dev/content/simulations/) will walk you through running the sample cases.

**Goals**
