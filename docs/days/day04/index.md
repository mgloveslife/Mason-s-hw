Day 4 consists of hours 3, 4, and 5 in the _C++ in 24 Hours_ book. These hours include:
- Creating Variables and Constants
- Using Expressions, Statements, and Operators
- Calling Functions

Even if these concepts seems like a review if you are familiar with them, it is recommended to read and complete each section to strengthen c/c++ skills.  The end of section activities should be completed in CLion and pushed to your private CodingAblate Repo.  This is done by creating a new day4 folder and updating the CMakeLists.txt file with any new files created in that folder.

**Goals**
1. Complete activities for Hours 3, 4, & 5.
2. Commit these activities and push to your private CodingAblate Repo.
