With the completion of the c/c++ background we pivot to learning about (PETSc)[https://petsc.org/release/].  Today try to install PETSc using the [ABLATE specific directions](https://ablate.dev/content/development/InstallingDependencies.html#install-petsc).  While installing review the [PETSc Manual](https://petsc.org/release/docs/manual/).  The manual will help you familiarize yourself with PETSC terminology.  

**Goals**
1. Compile debug and optimized PETSc on your machine.
2. Review the PETSc manual.
