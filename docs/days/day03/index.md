Before going any further you should become familiar with your CLion IDE.  Read and understand at least the [CLion Quick start guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/clion-quick-start-guide.html#learn-more).  With your local development environment up and running it is time to start exploring c/c++.  The first day consists of hours 1 and 2 in the _C++ in 24 Hours_ book.  These chapters will provide some historical context and an introduction to functions.  At the end of each Hour there is an Activities Section.  These activities should be completed in CLion and pushed to your private CodingAblate Repo.  This is done by creating a new day3 folder and updating the CMakeLists.txt file with any new files created in that folder.  This file tells the build system how to build your executables.  

**Goals**
1. Complete activities for Hour 1 and Hour 2.
2. Commit these activities and push to your private CodingAblate Repo.
